This system shows how our company is making sure the open source software we have is being used properly. A developer has to get the correct software package and send it through multiple scanners to get the desired results. The scanners are looking for any open source components, any vulnerabilities, and licenses that may be in the software package. The results of these scans are sent to the developer, and placed in databases so the developer and manager can access the results whenever they need it. The manager uses the results and compares them to the corporate policies, and the developer uses the results to create projects.
